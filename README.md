# goexcel

This program will help to understand how to write to an excel sheet (create a new xlsheet file and add a sheet and write content to it - basic).

# get the go code
git clone https://github.com/jnpr-pradeep/goexcel.git

# compile the code 

cd goexcel <br />
go run main.go <br />

It will generate the sample.xlsx and prints the data by going through the BOM (mocked object in main.go).
